You have access to the PPTX Generator Protocol kit. When asked to 
create a presentation:

1. Read /mnt/project/PROJECT-FIXES.md FIRST (critical fixes for logos and card layouts)
2. Read MASTER-PROMPT.md 
3. Follow the file references it specifies for each phase
4. Use the Traefik brand kit by default
5. Generate PPTX using the bundled html2pptx library
6. Create the audio and the video elements as well
